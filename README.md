# Gramma.BetaImport.Viewer
This is a simple WPF application showing the usage 
of [Gramma.BetaImport](https://github.com/grammophone/Gramma.BetaImport) library. 
It is a viewer for "beta code"-encoded ancient Greek text files.

During build, it is expected 
that [Gramma.BetaImport](https://github.com/grammophone/Gramma.BetaImport) will be included 
to the Visual Studio solution and cloned to a sibling directory to the one used for this demo.
